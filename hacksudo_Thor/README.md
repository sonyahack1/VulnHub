🔎 During the attack on the `hacksudo: Thor` system, directory scanning revealed an outdated and vulnerable `cgi-bin` directory containing two scripts: `backup.cgi` and `shell.sh`.
Exploitation of the `shellshock` vulnerability via the `shell.sh` script by injecting a command into the HTTP `User-Agent` header — allowed `Initial Access` to the system as the
`www-data` user. Subsequent `Local Enumeration` revealed a potentially insecure `sudoers` configuration for both the `www-data` and `thor` users, which ultimately led to `full system compromise`.
