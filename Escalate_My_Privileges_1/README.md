🔎 During the attack on the `Escalate My Privileges: 1` system, a network scan revealed an insecure publicly accessible page at `/phpbash.php`, which provided a web-based command shell
running with the privileges of the `apache` user. This allowed for `Initial Access` to the system by establishing a reverse shell to the attacker's machine.
Subsequent local `Enumeration` identified a potentially dangerous executable `python2.7` with the `SUID` bit set and owned by `root`. This led to full system compromise by leveraging a
one-liner in python to `Escalate Privileges`.
